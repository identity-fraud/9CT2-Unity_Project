# Factory Game: Project Documentation

## Identifying and Defining
### Need:
To fulfill the need of entertainment through a game that has fun and repeatable gameplay that makes people come back to play every time.

### Problem Statement:
Many games focus too much on graphics and end up presenting subpar and predictable storyline.

### Skill Development
To gain the skill required to create this kind of game I will need to use the Unity game engine and learn how to use it through Mr Scott's Unity Course.

## Requirements Outline
- Inputs: WASD/arrow keys for both right handed and left handed people, spacebar for people who are already used to jumping in 3D games and Q/E to allow more convenient dashing left/right
- Processing: The game needs to process those inputs and move the character correspondently.
- Outputs: Render and move the tiles/character
- Transmission: Not much requirements in data transmission for general gameplay
- Storage: Automatically save the players level completed

## Functional and Non-functional Requirements
### Functional:
#### Accessible input system
The game should use the WASD input system which allows the left hand to naturally sit on as well as that most people are used to using them already for gaming, it should also allow people to use the arrow keys to accomodate for people who have better right hand control. 

#### Repeatable gameplay
The game will be styled like a parkour/heavily movement focused game, as to allow the gameplay to be repeatable. We can also keep the gameplay more rewarding to make people to continue playing by making a fluid/skillful movement system.

#### Progression
The gameplay progression should teach the players on each mechanic while ramping up the difficulty progressively to keep it not boring or too easy. Further levels can be accessed in the menu screen after completing the previous levels, to ensure that the player does not make it too hard for themself.

#### UI
User interface should seamlessly allow someone to select and exit levels, and quit the game when they want.

#### Game Saves
Allows someone to save their levels completed, so that they don't lose progress when they quit and contine 

### Non-functional:
- Is supported on your machine
- Responsive and performant

## Social and Ethical Issues
- Game is pretty hard
-
