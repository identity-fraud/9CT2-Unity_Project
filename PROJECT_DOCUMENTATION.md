# Factory Game: Project Documentation

## Identifying and Defining
### Need:
To fulfill the need of entertainment through a game that has fun and repeatable gameplay that makes people come back to play every time.

### Problem Statement:
Many games focus too much on graphics but present subpar and boring graphics, even the story is left out sometimes and gets rushed and ends up with some predictable storyline.

### Skill Development
To gain the skill required to create this kind of game I will need to use the Unity game engine and learn how to use it through Mr Scott's Unity Course.

## Requirements Outline
- Inputs: WASD/arrow keys for both right handed and left handed people, spacebar for people who are already used to jumping in 3D games and Q/E to allow more convenient dashing left/right
- Processing: The game needs to process those inputs and move the character correspondently.
- Outputs: Render and move the tiles/character
- Transmission: Recommended specs: Windows 100000 Pro Enterprise, Radeon RX RTX 6070 Super X3D, Intel 
- Storage: Save the characters last location

## Functional and Non-functional Requirements

- Accessible/easy to use input system
- When inputting movement it should move on the screen
- Obstacles and walls should be interactable
- Start screen should allow to quit or continue
